#__Tom Riley Task Management System__

##Getting started 
#__install modules - npm install 
#__run code with node fuse watch or npm run watch

##Decisions 
#__Created data in the app.tsx and storing the dataset into redux to use in pages within the site
#__Created model based API data format so it can be easily plugged in for future
#__Have not seperated everything into small single functional components due to timeframes, this will be done properly in future
#__used paginator component to page between the task list
#__Not styled 
#__table header would normally be dynamic
