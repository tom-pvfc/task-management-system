#__Tom Riley Task Management System__

##Getting started 
1. install node_modules using command npm install 
2. run code in terminal with "npm run watch"

##Decisions 
- Created data in the app.tsx and storing the dataset into redux to use in pages within the site
- Created model based API data format so it can be easily plugged in for future
- Have not seperated everything into small single functional components due to timeframes, this will be done properly in future
- used paginator component to page between the task list
- Not styled 
- table header would normally be dynamic
- Not factorised. presentation code not noramlly in page, would have its own component.
